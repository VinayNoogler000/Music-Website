# Music Website

## Project Description

I, **Vinay Tambey**, created a Music website as a practice project using HTML and CSS technologies. This project aims to demonstrate my skills in front-end web development, particularly in creating responsive and visually appealing web pages.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Utilized CSS Flexbox and Media Queries to ensure the webpage is responsive across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a logo and four links for smooth scrolling to different sections of the webpage.
- **Overview Section**: Features a background image to provide an engaging introduction.
- **Music Section**: Contains two floating images to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Video Section**: Displays a background video that runs infinitely and is muted by default.
- **Gift-Cards Section**: Showcases a gift card image to highlight special offers.
- **Footer**: Includes non-functional links for design purposes.
